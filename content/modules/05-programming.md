# Programming for Long-Term Progress

## Lesson 1: Progressive Overload Models

**Core idea:** Overload can be load, volume, density, or range of motion.

- Use double progression to increase reps before weight.
- Track weekly volume to ensure sustainable growth.
- Adjust load when form or bar speed drops.

## Lesson 2: Periodization and Deloading

**Core idea:** Planned fatigue management preserves performance and growth.

- Schedule deloads every 4–8 weeks depending on experience.
- Reduce volume by 30–50% during deload weeks.
- Monitor readiness signals: sleep, mood, soreness, and performance.

## Lesson 3: Exercise Selection Framework

**Core idea:** Match the exercise to the muscle and the goal.

- Choose variations that align with desired moment arms.
- Balance compound lifts with isolation work.
- Include stabilization-focused movements for injury resilience.
