# Supplementation and Ergogenic Aids

## Lesson 1: Evidence Tiers and Research Quality

**Core idea:** Not all studies are equal; weigh evidence across trials.

- Prioritize meta-analyses and controlled trials.
- Evaluate practical effect size, not just p-values.
- Separate acute performance boosts from long-term adaptation.

## Lesson 2: Core Supplements

**Core idea:** A small set of supplements have consistent evidence.

- Creatine improves high-intensity performance.
- Caffeine improves power and endurance.
- Beta-alanine and nitrates support work capacity.

## Lesson 3: Micronutrients and Deficiency

**Core idea:** Correcting deficiencies yields bigger gains than stacking supplements.

- Monitor iron, vitamin D, magnesium, and omega-3 intake.
- Use labs to guide interventions.
- Food-first approach with targeted supplementation.

## Lesson 4: Safety, Purity, and Compliance

**Core idea:** Quality control protects health and eligibility.

- Use third-party tested products when possible.
- Avoid megadosing and polypharmacy.
- Track side effects and discontinue if issues arise.
