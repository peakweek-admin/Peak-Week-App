# Supplementation and Ergogenic Aids

Supplements are tools, not magic. This module teaches how to evaluate evidence, choose effective options, and avoid wasted money or health risks.

## Lesson 1: Evidence Tiers and Research Quality

**Core idea:** Not all studies are equal; weigh evidence across trials.

- Meta-analyses and systematic reviews carry the most weight.
- Effect size matters more than p-values.
- Context matters: trained vs untrained populations.

**Practical applications**
- Prioritize supplements with consistent high-quality evidence.
- Avoid products built on single small studies.
- Look for independent replication.

## Lesson 2: Core Supplements

**Core idea:** A small set of supplements have consistent evidence.

- Creatine improves high-intensity performance.
- Caffeine improves power and endurance.
- Beta-alanine improves work capacity.
- Nitrates support blood flow and endurance.

**Practical applications**
- Use creatine daily (3–5g).
- Time caffeine 30–60 minutes before training.
- Split beta-alanine doses to reduce tingling.

## Lesson 3: Micronutrients and Deficiency

**Core idea:** Correcting deficiencies yields bigger gains than stacking supplements.

- Common gaps: vitamin D, iron, magnesium, omega-3s.
- Lab testing provides clarity.
- Food-first approach reduces reliance on pills.

**Practical applications**
- Use blood work annually if possible.
- Build meals around whole foods first.
- Supplement only what’s missing.

## Lesson 4: Safety, Purity, and Compliance

**Core idea:** Quality control protects health and eligibility.

- Use third-party tested products when possible.
- Avoid megadosing and polypharmacy.
- Track side effects and discontinue if issues arise.

## Lesson 5: Supplement Strategy Framework

**Core idea:** Supplements should support, not replace, training and nutrition.

- Build the base: sleep, nutrition, training.
- Add only high-evidence supplements.
- Review outcomes every 4–6 weeks.

**Takeaway:** The best supplement plan is simple, consistent, and evidence-based.

## Deep Dive: Ergogenic Timing and Individual Response

Not all supplements work the same for everyone. Genetics, sleep, and training status change response.

- Some people respond strongly to caffeine; others feel anxious.
- Creatine responders gain more strength and water in muscle.
- Trial periods help you decide if a supplement is worth it.

## Common Mistakes

- Using too many supplements at once.
- Skipping the basics and relying on pills.
- Using untested products with unknown ingredients.

## Practical Checklist

- Are you using only evidence-backed supplements?
- Do you track performance before and after adding one?
- Have you checked for contraindications?

## Example Application: Simple Supplement Stack

- Creatine daily.
- Caffeine before heavy sessions.
- Omega-3 if dietary intake is low.

**Action step:** Remove any supplement that doesn’t clearly improve training or recovery.

## Field Notes: Supplement Evaluation

Before adding any supplement, answer these:

- What evidence supports it?
- What is the expected effect size?
- What is the risk profile?

## Exercise Selection Examples (Supplement Timing)

- Use caffeine on heavy or high-volume days.
- Avoid caffeine late in the day if sleep suffers.
- Use creatine consistently, not only on training days.

## Glossary

- **Ergogenic:** performance enhancing.
- **Third-party testing:** independent purity verification.
- **Placebo effect:** improvement due to expectations.

## Self-Test Prompts

- Is this supplement improving performance measurably?
- Is it affecting sleep or recovery?
- Can you remove it without losing results?

## Case Studies: Supplement Decisions

- **No performance change after 6 weeks:** remove the supplement.
- **Sleep disrupted by caffeine:** reduce dose or timing.
- **GI issues with creatine:** split into smaller doses.

## Coaching Cues Library

- “Food first, supplements second.”
- “One change at a time.”
- “Track results objectively.”

## Reflection Questions

- Which supplement gives you a measurable benefit?
- Are any supplements harming sleep or appetite?
- Do you rely on supplements instead of basics?

## Quick Recap

- Evidence matters more than hype.
- Creatine and caffeine have strong support.
- Purity and dosing protect health.
- Supplements should not replace basics.

## Mini Assignment

- Pick one supplement and track response for 4 weeks.
- Record training performance and sleep quality.
- Decide whether it stays in your plan.

## Further Reading Prompts

- How do you separate placebo from real effect?
- Which supplements feel most helpful for your training?

## Extended Notes

Use these notes as a quick reference when planning training or nutrition.

- Focus on one key variable per block.
- Track results with simple logs.
- Favor consistency over novelty.
- Use deloads or diet breaks proactively.
- Protect joints with smart exercise choices.
- Keep recovery habits stable.
- Reassess every 4–6 weeks.

## Applied Checklist

- What is the one change that will move the needle most this block?
- What is your main risk (fatigue, soreness, compliance)?
- What is your plan to manage that risk?

## Key Formula

- Plan → Execute → Review → Adjust

## Interactive Drill

Use this drill to apply the key ideas:

1. Pick one main lift or habit from this module.
2. Write down the problem you are solving (strength, size, recovery, adherence).
3. Choose one variable to adjust (load, ROM, sleep, calories).
4. Track the result for 2–4 weeks.

## Knowledge Map

- **Inputs:** training, nutrition, recovery, stress.
- **Signals:** performance, soreness, sleep, motivation.
- **Outputs:** strength, size, body composition, confidence.

## Applied Lab

- Build a mini-plan for the next 2 weeks.
- Record one key metric daily (steps, reps, or sleep).
- Review results and adjust only one variable.

## Troubleshooting Guide

- If progress stalls, reduce complexity and return to fundamentals.
- If joints ache, change exercise selection before lowering effort.
- If motivation drops, shorten sessions and focus on quality.

## Study Guide Prompts

- Which variable gives you the highest return on effort?
- What recovery habit would most improve your next block?
- How will you measure progress beyond scale weight?
