# Supplementation and Ergogenic Aids

Supplements are tools, not magic. This module teaches how to evaluate evidence, choose effective options, and avoid wasted money or health risks.

## Lesson 1: Evidence Tiers and Research Quality

**Core idea:** Not all studies are equal; weigh evidence across trials.

- Meta-analyses and systematic reviews carry the most weight.
- Effect size matters more than p-values.
- Context matters: trained vs untrained populations.

**Practical applications**
- Prioritize supplements with consistent high-quality evidence.
- Avoid products built on single small studies.
- Look for independent replication.

## Lesson 2: Core Supplements

**Core idea:** A small set of supplements have consistent evidence.

- Creatine improves high-intensity performance.
- Caffeine improves power and endurance.
- Beta-alanine improves work capacity.
- Nitrates support blood flow and endurance.

**Practical applications**
- Use creatine daily (3–5g).
- Time caffeine 30–60 minutes before training.
- Split beta-alanine doses to reduce tingling.

## Lesson 3: Micronutrients and Deficiency

**Core idea:** Correcting deficiencies yields bigger gains than stacking supplements.

- Common gaps: vitamin D, iron, magnesium, omega-3s.
- Lab testing provides clarity.
- Food-first approach reduces reliance on pills.

**Practical applications**
- Use blood work annually if possible.
- Build meals around whole foods first.
- Supplement only what’s missing.

## Lesson 4: Safety, Purity, and Compliance

**Core idea:** Quality control protects health and eligibility.

- Use third-party tested products when possible.
- Avoid megadosing and polypharmacy.
- Track side effects and discontinue if issues arise.

## Lesson 5: Supplement Strategy Framework

**Core idea:** Supplements should support, not replace, training and nutrition.

- Build the base: sleep, nutrition, training.
- Add only high-evidence supplements.
- Review outcomes every 4–6 weeks.

**Takeaway:** The best supplement plan is simple, consistent, and evidence-based.

## Deep Dive: Ergogenic Timing and Individual Response

Not all supplements work the same for everyone. Genetics, sleep, and training status change response.

- Some people respond strongly to caffeine; others feel anxious.
- Creatine responders gain more strength and water in muscle.
- Trial periods help you decide if a supplement is worth it.

## Common Mistakes

- Using too many supplements at once.
- Skipping the basics and relying on pills.
- Using untested products with unknown ingredients.

## Practical Checklist

- Are you using only evidence-backed supplements?
- Do you track performance before and after adding one?
- Have you checked for contraindications?

## Example Application: Simple Supplement Stack

- Creatine daily.
- Caffeine before heavy sessions.
- Omega-3 if dietary intake is low.

**Action step:** Remove any supplement that doesn’t clearly improve training or recovery.


## Mechanisms: Evidence Strength and Effect Size

**Core idea:** Supplements should be judged by effect size, not hype. Small effects can still matter, but only if the evidence is consistent.

- Meta-analyses and systematic reviews carry more weight.
- Effect size determines practical relevance.
- Study quality and participant training status influence outcomes.

## Mechanisms: Ergogenic Timing and Response

**Core idea:** Timing and individual response determine whether a supplement is worth using.

- Caffeine works acutely and depends on timing and tolerance.
- Creatine is chronic; it depends on saturation.
- Nitrates depend on timing and diet background.

## Mechanisms: Safety and Compliance

**Core idea:** Purity and safety protect health and eligibility.

- Contaminants are a real risk with untested supplements.
- High doses increase side effects without proportional benefit.
- Third-party testing reduces risk.

## Why It Matters: Sustainable Performance Gains

- **Safe supplementation** preserves health.
- **Evidence-based choices** prevent wasted money.
- **Consistency** determines real-world impact.

**Takeaway:** Supplements are a small layer on top of sleep, training, and nutrition.
