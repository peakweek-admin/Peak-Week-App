# Recovery Monitoring and Load Management

## Lesson 1: Readiness Metrics

**Core idea:** Objective and subjective data work best together.

- Track resting heart rate and HRV trends.
- Use readiness surveys to capture mood and soreness.
- Watch for multi-day downward trends.

## Lesson 2: Load Management Models

**Core idea:** Acute-to-chronic workload balances progress with recovery.

- Avoid abrupt spikes in volume or intensity.
- Track weekly sets per muscle group.
- Build gradual ramps across mesocycles.

## Lesson 3: Deload Strategy and Tapering

**Core idea:** Planned reductions restore performance.

- Cut volume 30–50% while keeping technique sharp.
- Use tapering before performance peaks.
- Plan deloads around travel or high-stress weeks.

## Lesson 4: Recovery Interventions

**Core idea:** Interventions are multipliers, not replacements.

- Use mobility and light cardio for active recovery.
- Prioritize hydration and electrolyte balance.
- Avoid overuse of recovery modalities that mask fatigue.
