# Fueling for Performance and Composition

Nutrition is more than calorie math. It is the recovery system that makes training adaptations possible. This module connects energy balance to performance, hormones, and body composition.

## Lesson 1: Energy Balance and TDEE

**Core idea:** Total daily energy expenditure combines basal needs, activity, and NEAT.

- **BMR** covers essential function.
- **NEAT** can vary dramatically with stress and diet.
- **Exercise** is only part of total expenditure.

**Practical applications**
- Start with a baseline estimate and adjust weekly.
- Use 2–4 week trend averages, not single days.
- Adjust calories by small increments (100–200 kcal).

## Lesson 2: NEAT and Adaptive Behavior

**Core idea:** NEAT often drops during deficits and increases during surpluses.

- Dieting can make you move less without noticing.
- Walking targets keep NEAT consistent.
- Sleep and stress also shift NEAT behavior.

**Practical applications**
- Set a step target that you can maintain.
- Track activity with a simple daily check-in.
- Use diet breaks to restore spontaneous activity.

## Lesson 3: Macronutrient Targets

**Core idea:** Protein supports growth, carbs fuel training, fats support hormones.

- Protein: 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day.
- Carbs: more on training days for performance.
- Fats: minimum 20–30% of calories.

**Practical applications**
- Use protein distribution (25–40g per meal).
- Place carbs around training sessions.
- Keep fats higher on rest days if carbs drop.

## Lesson 4: Nutrient Timing and Meal Structure

**Core idea:** Timing improves training quality and recovery.

- Pre-training meal 1–3 hours before lifting.
- Post-training protein + carbs for glycogen restoration.
- Spread protein across 3–5 meals for MPS.

**Practical applications**
- Plan meals around your training window.
- Use a consistent pre-workout meal to stabilize energy.
- Avoid high-fat meals right before training.

## Lesson 5: Diet Periodization

**Core idea:** Cycling phases of maintenance, surplus, and deficit improves outcomes.

- Maintenance supports recovery and skill refinement.
- Surplus phases support hypertrophy blocks.
- Deficit phases reduce body fat while preserving strength.

**Practical applications**
- Align diet phases with training goals.
- Use maintenance weeks every 6–12 weeks.
- Monitor performance to avoid excessive deficits.

## Lesson 6: Energy Availability and Hormones

**Core idea:** Chronic low energy availability disrupts hormones and recovery.

- Low energy can reduce thyroid output and sex hormones.
- Performance drops before body weight changes sometimes show up.
- Refeed or maintenance weeks can restore function.

**Takeaway:** Fueling is the foundation for training quality and long-term progress.

## Deep Dive: Thermic Effect of Food

The thermic effect of food (TEF) is the energy used to digest and process meals. Protein has the highest TEF, which makes it valuable during deficits and surplus phases alike.

- Protein TEF: ~20–30%
- Carbs TEF: ~5–10%
- Fat TEF: ~0–3%

## Common Mistakes

- Cutting calories too aggressively and losing training output.
- Neglecting protein distribution across the day.
- Ignoring NEAT changes during dieting phases.

## Practical Checklist

- Are you hitting protein targets daily?
- Are carbs positioned around training sessions?
- Are fats high enough for hormone support?
- Is your step count stable week to week?

## Example Application: Cutting Phase

- Reduce calories by 10–15% below maintenance.
- Keep protein at 1.8–2.2 g/kg.
- Maintain training intensity while reducing volume slightly.
- Add a diet break every 6–8 weeks.

**Action step:** Track 7-day average weight and adjust calories only when the trend stalls.


## Mechanisms: Energy Balance and Adaptive Metabolism

**Core idea:** The body adapts to sustained deficits or surpluses by changing energy expenditure. This is why calorie needs shift over time.

- NEAT often decreases during dieting, reducing total daily burn.
- Resting metabolic rate can drop with prolonged energy deficits.
- Diet breaks temporarily reverse adaptive suppression and improve training output.

## Mechanisms: Protein and Muscle Retention

**Core idea:** Protein provides amino acids that sustain muscle protein synthesis and reduce muscle loss during deficits.

- Higher protein intake maintains nitrogen balance.
- Even protein distribution increases daily MPS spikes.
- Protein intake supports recovery and connective tissue remodeling.

## Mechanisms: Carbohydrates, Training Output, and Hormones

**Core idea:** Carbs replenish glycogen, which fuels high-intensity work. Low glycogen reduces performance and increases perceived effort.

- Glycogen depletion reduces training volume capacity.
- Adequate carbs support thyroid and leptin signaling.
- Timing carbs around training improves output and recovery.

## Why It Matters: Outcomes Over Time

- **Sustainable deficits** preserve strength and muscle.
- **Stable NEAT** prevents hidden energy drops.
- **Consistent fueling** keeps training quality high.

**Takeaway:** Nutrition success is driven by energy balance, macronutrient distribution, and adaptation management.
