# Fueling for Performance and Composition

## Lesson 1: Energy Balance and TDEE

**Core idea:** Total daily energy expenditure combines basal needs, activity, and NEAT.

- Start with a baseline estimate and adjust weekly based on scale trends.
- Track NEAT habits (steps, active minutes) to reduce daily variability.
- Use moderate surpluses for growth and moderate deficits for fat loss.

## Lesson 2: Macronutrient Targets

**Core idea:** Protein supports growth, carbs fuel training, fats support hormones.

- Protein: 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day depending on goal and experience.
- Carbs: higher on training days for performance and recovery.
- Fats: keep at least 20–30% of calories to support hormones.

## Lesson 3: Whole Foods and Nutrient Timing

**Core idea:** Whole foods improve satiety and micronutrients; timing boosts performance.

- Build meals around lean protein, complex carbs, colorful produce, and healthy fats.
- Add a pre-training meal 1–3 hours before lifting.
- Post-training meals should include protein and carbs for glycogen restoration.
