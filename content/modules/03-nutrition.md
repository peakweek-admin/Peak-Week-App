# Fueling for Performance and Composition

## Lesson 1: Energy Balance and TDEE

**Core idea:** Total daily energy expenditure combines basal needs, activity, and NEAT.

- Start with a baseline estimate and adjust weekly.
- Track NEAT habits (steps, active minutes) to reduce variability.
- Use moderate surpluses for growth and modest deficits for fat loss.

## Lesson 2: Macronutrient Targets

**Core idea:** Protein supports growth, carbs fuel training, fats support hormones.

- Protein: 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day depending on goal and experience.
- Carbs: higher on training days for performance and recovery.
- Fats: keep at least 20–30% of calories to support hormones.

## Lesson 3: Nutrient Timing and Meal Structure

**Core idea:** Timing improves training quality and recovery.

- Pre-training meal 1–3 hours before lifting.
- Post-training protein + carbs for glycogen restoration.
- Spread protein across 3–5 meals for MPS.

## Lesson 4: Diet Periodization

**Core idea:** Cycling phases of maintenance, surplus, and deficit improves outcomes.

- Use maintenance weeks to stabilize NEAT and recovery.
- Plan surplus phases alongside hypertrophy blocks.
- Deload nutrition alongside training deloads.
