# Fueling for Performance and Composition

Nutrition is more than calorie math. It is the recovery system that makes training adaptations possible. This module connects energy balance to performance, hormones, and body composition.

## Lesson 1: Energy Balance and TDEE

**Core idea:** Total daily energy expenditure combines basal needs, activity, and NEAT.

- **BMR** covers essential function.
- **NEAT** can vary dramatically with stress and diet.
- **Exercise** is only part of total expenditure.

**Practical applications**
- Start with a baseline estimate and adjust weekly.
- Use 2–4 week trend averages, not single days.
- Adjust calories by small increments (100–200 kcal).

## Lesson 2: NEAT and Adaptive Behavior

**Core idea:** NEAT often drops during deficits and increases during surpluses.

- Dieting can make you move less without noticing.
- Walking targets keep NEAT consistent.
- Sleep and stress also shift NEAT behavior.

**Practical applications**
- Set a step target that you can maintain.
- Track activity with a simple daily check-in.
- Use diet breaks to restore spontaneous activity.

## Lesson 3: Macronutrient Targets

**Core idea:** Protein supports growth, carbs fuel training, fats support hormones.

- Protein: 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day.
- Carbs: more on training days for performance.
- Fats: minimum 20–30% of calories.

**Practical applications**
- Use protein distribution (25–40g per meal).
- Place carbs around training sessions.
- Keep fats higher on rest days if carbs drop.

## Lesson 4: Nutrient Timing and Meal Structure

**Core idea:** Timing improves training quality and recovery.

- Pre-training meal 1–3 hours before lifting.
- Post-training protein + carbs for glycogen restoration.
- Spread protein across 3–5 meals for MPS.

**Practical applications**
- Plan meals around your training window.
- Use a consistent pre-workout meal to stabilize energy.
- Avoid high-fat meals right before training.

## Lesson 5: Diet Periodization

**Core idea:** Cycling phases of maintenance, surplus, and deficit improves outcomes.

- Maintenance supports recovery and skill refinement.
- Surplus phases support hypertrophy blocks.
- Deficit phases reduce body fat while preserving strength.

**Practical applications**
- Align diet phases with training goals.
- Use maintenance weeks every 6–12 weeks.
- Monitor performance to avoid excessive deficits.

## Lesson 6: Energy Availability and Hormones

**Core idea:** Chronic low energy availability disrupts hormones and recovery.

- Low energy can reduce thyroid output and sex hormones.
- Performance drops before body weight changes sometimes show up.
- Refeed or maintenance weeks can restore function.

**Takeaway:** Fueling is the foundation for training quality and long-term progress.

## Deep Dive: Thermic Effect of Food

The thermic effect of food (TEF) is the energy used to digest and process meals. Protein has the highest TEF, which makes it valuable during deficits and surplus phases alike.

- Protein TEF: ~20–30%
- Carbs TEF: ~5–10%
- Fat TEF: ~0–3%

## Common Mistakes

- Cutting calories too aggressively and losing training output.
- Neglecting protein distribution across the day.
- Ignoring NEAT changes during dieting phases.

## Practical Checklist

- Are you hitting protein targets daily?
- Are carbs positioned around training sessions?
- Are fats high enough for hormone support?
- Is your step count stable week to week?

## Example Application: Cutting Phase

- Reduce calories by 10–15% below maintenance.
- Keep protein at 1.8–2.2 g/kg.
- Maintain training intensity while reducing volume slightly.
- Add a diet break every 6–8 weeks.

**Action step:** Track 7-day average weight and adjust calories only when the trend stalls.

## Field Notes: Diet Adherence

Consistency matters more than perfection. The best plan is one you can follow.

- Build meals you actually enjoy.
- Use a weekly meal template to reduce decision fatigue.
- Track hunger signals to adjust meal timing.

## Exercise Selection Examples (Nutrition Focus)

- **High-volume training days:** higher carbs and fluids.
- **Rest days:** keep protein high, carbs slightly lower.
- **Travel days:** prioritize protein and hydration.

## Glossary

- **NEAT:** non-exercise activity thermogenesis.
- **TEF:** thermic effect of food.
- **Energy availability:** calories remaining after exercise costs.

## Self-Test Prompts

- Are you consistently hitting protein targets?
- Is your weight trend moving in the intended direction?
- Do you have enough energy for high-quality training?

## Case Studies: Macro Adjustments

- **Low energy in training:** increase carbs pre-workout.
- **Slow fat loss:** reduce calories 100–200 kcal and add steps.
- **Recovery lagging:** increase protein or total calories.

## Coaching Cues Library

- “Plan meals ahead” to reduce decision fatigue.
- “Protein first” to anchor each meal.
- “Hydrate early” to reduce false hunger.

## Reflection Questions

- Do you feel strongest on higher-carb days?
- Are you eating enough to recover from your training volume?
- How consistent is your nutrition during stressful weeks?

## Quick Recap

- TDEE sets the baseline for all goals.
- Protein supports muscle retention and growth.
- NEAT is a hidden driver of energy balance.
- Periodized diets improve adherence.

## Mini Assignment

- Track 7 days of protein intake.
- Adjust one meal to hit your target.
- Reassess energy levels in training.

## Further Reading Prompts

- How does meal timing affect your gym performance?
- What habits make adherence easier during a deficit?

## Extended Notes

Use these notes as a quick reference when planning training or nutrition.

- Focus on one key variable per block.
- Track results with simple logs.
- Favor consistency over novelty.
- Use deloads or diet breaks proactively.
- Protect joints with smart exercise choices.
- Keep recovery habits stable.
- Reassess every 4–6 weeks.

## Applied Checklist

- What is the one change that will move the needle most this block?
- What is your main risk (fatigue, soreness, compliance)?
- What is your plan to manage that risk?

## Key Formula

- Plan → Execute → Review → Adjust

## Interactive Drill

Use this drill to apply the key ideas:

1. Pick one main lift or habit from this module.
2. Write down the problem you are solving (strength, size, recovery, adherence).
3. Choose one variable to adjust (load, ROM, sleep, calories).
4. Track the result for 2–4 weeks.

## Knowledge Map

- **Inputs:** training, nutrition, recovery, stress.
- **Signals:** performance, soreness, sleep, motivation.
- **Outputs:** strength, size, body composition, confidence.

## Applied Lab

- Build a mini-plan for the next 2 weeks.
- Record one key metric daily (steps, reps, or sleep).
- Review results and adjust only one variable.

## Troubleshooting Guide

- If progress stalls, reduce complexity and return to fundamentals.
- If joints ache, change exercise selection before lowering effort.
- If motivation drops, shorten sessions and focus on quality.

## Study Guide Prompts

- Which variable gives you the highest return on effort?
- What recovery habit would most improve your next block?
- How will you measure progress beyond scale weight?
