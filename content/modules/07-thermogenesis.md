# Energy Systems, Thermogenesis, and Metabolism

## Lesson 1: ATP Systems for Training

**Core idea:** Energy system dominance changes with intensity and duration.

- ATP-PC fuels heavy lifts and short bursts.
- Glycolysis powers moderate rep work.
- Oxidative system supports recovery and endurance.

## Lesson 2: Thermogenesis and Energy Expenditure

**Core idea:** Thermogenesis includes exercise, NEAT, and food-induced thermogenesis.

- Protein has a higher thermic effect than carbs or fats.
- Cold exposure and movement increase non-exercise thermogenesis.
- Track NEAT to prevent hidden energy drops.

## Lesson 3: Adaptive Metabolism

**Core idea:** The body adapts to deficits and surpluses over time.

- Extended deficits reduce RMR and NEAT.
- Diet breaks restore performance and adherence.
- Adjust calories based on weekly trends.

## Lesson 4: Metabolic Flexibility

**Core idea:** The ability to switch between fuel sources improves recovery.

- Train both high and low carbohydrate sessions.
- Use aerobic work to improve fat oxidation.
- Avoid chronic low energy availability.
