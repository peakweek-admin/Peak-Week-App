# Energy Systems, Thermogenesis, and Metabolism

This module explains the energy engines that power training and how dieting changes the body’s metabolic behavior over time.

## Lesson 1: ATP Systems for Training

**Core idea:** Energy system dominance changes with intensity and duration.

- ATP-PC fuels heavy lifts and short bursts.
- Glycolysis powers moderate rep work.
- Oxidative system supports recovery and endurance.

**Practical applications**
- Strength training relies heavily on ATP-PC.
- Hypertrophy work shifts toward glycolysis.
- Aerobic work improves recovery and work capacity.

## Lesson 2: Thermogenesis and Energy Expenditure

**Core idea:** Thermogenesis includes exercise, NEAT, and food-induced thermogenesis.

- Protein has the highest thermic effect.
- NEAT changes often explain dieting plateaus.
- Movement breaks increase non-exercise thermogenesis.

**Practical applications**
- Increase daily steps during fat-loss phases.
- Keep protein high to preserve lean mass.
- Use meal timing to stabilize energy.

## Lesson 3: Adaptive Metabolism

**Core idea:** The body adapts to deficits and surpluses over time.

- Extended deficits reduce RMR and NEAT.
- Diet breaks restore performance and adherence.
- Refeeds can temporarily boost leptin and training quality.

**Practical applications**
- Use 1–2 week maintenance breaks every 6–12 weeks.
- Track performance and mood for early warning signs.
- Adjust calories based on weekly trends, not daily swings.

## Lesson 4: Metabolic Flexibility

**Core idea:** The ability to switch between fuel sources improves recovery.

- Aerobic work improves fat oxidation.
- Carbs support high-intensity performance.
- Consistent deficits reduce flexibility over time.

**Practical applications**
- Pair strength work with low-intensity cardio.
- Use mixed macro days for variety and adherence.
- Avoid chronic low energy availability.

## Lesson 5: Thermogenesis and Body Composition

**Core idea:** Body composition changes are influenced by thermogenesis and training quality.

- Higher muscle mass increases resting energy demand.
- Poor recovery reduces thermogenesis and training output.
- Resistance training protects lean mass during deficits.

**Takeaway:** Metabolism is dynamic. Use nutrition, movement, and recovery to keep it working for you.

## Deep Dive: Thermogenesis and Diet Adherence

Thermogenesis affects how hard dieting feels. When energy expenditure drops, hunger rises and adherence becomes harder. Understanding this helps you plan smarter diet phases.

- Diet breaks reduce perceived effort.
- Higher protein helps preserve lean mass.
- Consistent movement keeps NEAT higher.

## Common Mistakes

- Cutting calories too aggressively early.
- Dropping NEAT without noticing.
- Relying on “metabolism boosters” instead of habits.

## Practical Checklist

- Are you tracking weekly weight trends?
- Are you keeping protein stable during deficits?
- Are you using diet breaks to restore performance?

## Example Application: Fat Loss Block

- 8–12 week deficit with maintenance breaks.
- Maintain strength training intensity.
- Keep steps above a daily threshold.

**Action step:** Reassess calories every 2–3 weeks, not daily.

## Field Notes: Metabolic Tracking

Use a weekly review to see if metabolism is adapting.

- Body weight trend (7-day average).
- Training performance changes.
- Hunger and energy ratings.

## Exercise Selection Examples

- **Thermogenesis support:** incline walking, cycling, easy jogging.
- **Strength preservation:** heavy compound lifts 2–4x per week.
- **Recovery support:** low-intensity movement on off days.

## Glossary

- **RMR:** resting metabolic rate.
- **Adaptive thermogenesis:** metabolism slowing during deficits.
- **Fuel partitioning:** where calories go (muscle vs fat).

## Self-Test Prompts

- Has your NEAT dropped since dieting started?
- Are you still hitting training performance targets?
- Do you need a maintenance break to restore energy?

## Case Studies: Plateau Fixes

- **Plateau after 6 weeks:** add a maintenance week.
- **Low energy:** reduce deficit and increase carbs around training.
- **NEAT drop:** increase daily step goal.

## Coaching Cues Library

- “Small changes beat large swings.”
- “Trend data > daily data.”
- “Protect performance while cutting.”

## Reflection Questions

- Is your deficit small enough to maintain performance?
- Are your steps consistent week to week?
- Would a diet break improve adherence?

## Quick Recap

- ATP systems shift with intensity and duration.
- Thermogenesis drives energy expenditure.
- Adaptive metabolism slows long deficits.
- Metabolic flexibility supports performance.

## Mini Assignment

- Track steps for 7 days.
- Add 1,000 steps per day for a week.
- Note changes in hunger and weight trend.

## Further Reading Prompts

- How does NEAT change when stress increases?
- What signs suggest your deficit is too large?

## Extended Notes

Use these notes as a quick reference when planning training or nutrition.

- Focus on one key variable per block.
- Track results with simple logs.
- Favor consistency over novelty.
- Use deloads or diet breaks proactively.
- Protect joints with smart exercise choices.
- Keep recovery habits stable.
- Reassess every 4–6 weeks.

## Applied Checklist

- What is the one change that will move the needle most this block?
- What is your main risk (fatigue, soreness, compliance)?
- What is your plan to manage that risk?

## Key Formula

- Plan → Execute → Review → Adjust
