# Applied Anatomy and Movement Physiology

## Lesson 1: Joint Anatomy and Constraints

**Core idea:** Joint structure determines allowable motion and safe loading angles.

- Identify primary joint actions and end ranges.
- Recognize structural limitations vs mobility deficits.
- Choose exercises that respect joint geometry.

## Lesson 2: Muscle Actions and Synergy

**Core idea:** Prime movers work with synergists and stabilizers to control movement.

- Distinguish concentric, eccentric, and isometric roles.
- Identify stabilizers for major lifts.
- Use tempo and pauses to reinforce synergy.

## Lesson 3: Fascial Lines and Force Transfer

**Core idea:** Fascia transmits force across the kinetic chain.

- Train posterior and anterior chains for balance.
- Integrate rotational and anti-rotational work.
- Use carries to improve whole-body stability.

## Lesson 4: Movement Screening and Exercise Selection

**Core idea:** Screening reveals movement limitations and informs exercise choice.

- Identify compensation patterns in squats, hinges, and presses.
- Select regressions that improve mechanics.
- Retest to confirm adaptation.
