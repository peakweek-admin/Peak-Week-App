# Foundations of Lifting Biomechanics

## Lesson 1: Moment Arms and Torque Demands

**Core idea:** Torque equals force times the perpendicular distance (moment arm). As joint angles change, the moment arm changes, which changes the torque demand on the muscle.

- Identify the sticking point in each lift and map it to where the moment arm is longest.
- Use accommodating resistance (bands, chains) to match strength curves.
- Choose exercise variations that bias the moment arm toward your goal muscle (e.g., heels-elevated squats for quad focus).

## Lesson 2: Stabilization and Leverage

**Core idea:** Stabilizers reduce energy leaks so prime movers can express force.

- Track which joints need to stay rigid (core, scapula, hips) for the movement.
- Leverage depends on limb length, bar placement, and equipment choice.
- Machines reduce stabilization needs; free weights increase it and build coordination.

## Lesson 3: Anatomy for Movement Quality

**Core idea:** Origins, insertions, and fiber directions determine how muscles contribute to movement.

- Map each muscle’s line of pull to joint actions.
- Use anatomical knowledge to select angles that align fibers with resistance.
- Train stabilizers with deliberate tempo or pauses.
