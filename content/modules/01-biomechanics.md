# Foundations of Lifting Biomechanics

## Lesson 1: Moment Arms and Torque Curves

**Core idea:** Torque equals force times the perpendicular distance to the joint. As joint angles change, the moment arm changes, which changes torque demands.

- Map sticking points to the longest moment arm.
- Compare free weights vs machines for different torque curves.
- Use accommodating resistance to match strength curves.

## Lesson 2: Lever Classes and Anthropometry

**Core idea:** Limb lengths alter leverage and joint loading.

- Long femurs increase hip torque in squats.
- Shorter arms improve bench press leverage but reduce row ROM.
- Adjust stance, bar position, and equipment to match structure.

## Lesson 3: Stability, Bracing, and Energy Transfer

**Core idea:** Stabilizers reduce energy leaks so prime movers can express force.

- Use 360° bracing to maintain trunk stiffness.
- Train scapular stability for pulling and pressing.
- Choose unilateral work to expose asymmetries.

## Lesson 4: Range of Motion and Resistance Profiles

**Core idea:** Range of motion changes mechanical tension and muscle length.

- Longer ROM improves hypertrophy signaling for many muscles.
- Partial ROM can overload specific joint angles.
- Use tempo to increase time under tension without compromising form.
