# Peptides, SARMs, and Pharmacology (Educational Only)

> **Disclaimer:** This content is educational and does not recommend or instruct the use of controlled or prescription substances. Consult medical professionals for any health decisions.

## Lesson 1: Endocrine System Overview

**Core idea:** The endocrine system regulates growth, recovery, and metabolism through hormone signaling.

- HPTA and HPA axis fundamentals.
- Feedback loops and suppression risks.
- Long-term consequences of dysregulation.

## Lesson 2: Peptides and Growth Pathways

**Core idea:** Peptides can influence growth signaling, but evidence and safety vary.

- Mechanisms commonly discussed in research.
- Tissue-specific effects and unknowns.
- Risk assessment and regulation.

## Lesson 3: SARMs and Selective Signaling

**Core idea:** SARMs target androgen receptors but still carry systemic risks.

- Potential impacts on lipids, liver markers, and hormones.
- Differences between acute effects and long-term outcomes.
- Emphasis on risk awareness and medical oversight.

## Lesson 4: Harm Reduction and Ethics

**Core idea:** Health-first decisions prioritize long-term outcomes and legality.

- Screening, monitoring, and red flags.
- Regulatory status and sport compliance.
- Safer alternatives: sleep, training, nutrition, and evidence-based supplements.
