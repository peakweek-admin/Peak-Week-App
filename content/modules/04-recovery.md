# Recovery, Hormones, and Lifestyle

## Lesson 1: Sleep Quality and Adaptation

**Core idea:** Sleep is the most powerful recovery tool and regulates hormones, mood, and performance.

- Aim for consistent bed and wake times.
- Optimize the sleep environment (dark, cool, quiet).
- Track daytime fatigue and adjust training if needed.

## Lesson 2: Hormonal Environment

**Core idea:** Acute hormone spikes are less important than chronic balance and recovery.

- Avoid chronic calorie deficits when chasing hypertrophy.
- Use deloads and active recovery to keep stress hormones in check.
- Prioritize protein and fats to support anabolic signaling.

## Lesson 3: Stress, Autonomic Balance, and CNS Fatigue

**Core idea:** Chronic stress shifts recovery capacity and dampens adaptation.

- Monitor mood, sleep latency, and resting heart rate.
- Use breathwork and walks to downshift sympathetic drive.
- Reduce volume before intensity if stress climbs.

## Lesson 4: Recovery Stack

**Core idea:** Recovery is a layered system, not a single tool.

- Build a baseline: sleep, nutrition, hydration.
- Add recovery modalities only after fundamentals are in place.
- Track readiness markers weekly.
