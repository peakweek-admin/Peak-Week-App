# Recovery, Hormones, and Lifestyle

## Lesson 1: Sleep Quality and Adaptation

**Core idea:** Sleep is the most powerful recovery tool and regulates hormones, mood, and performance.

- Aim for consistent bed and wake times.
- Optimize the sleep environment (dark, cool, quiet).
- Track daytime fatigue and adjust training if needed.

## Lesson 2: Hormonal Environment

**Core idea:** Acute hormone spikes are less important than chronic balance and recovery.

- Avoid chronic calorie deficits when chasing hypertrophy.
- Use deloads and active recovery to keep stress hormones in check.
- Prioritize protein and fats to support anabolic signaling.

## Lesson 3: Lifestyle Recovery Systems

**Core idea:** Recovery is a lifestyle system, not a single tool.

- Schedule weekly low-stress days.
- Use walks, mobility, and breathing drills to downshift the nervous system.
- Track resting heart rate and HRV to detect fatigue early.
