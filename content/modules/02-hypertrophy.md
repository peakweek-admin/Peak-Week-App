# Muscle Growth From Cell to System

## Lesson 1: Mechanical Tension as the Primary Driver

**Core idea:** Mechanical tension is the strongest stimulus for hypertrophy.

- Use full ROM and controlled eccentrics to increase tension.
- Train close to failure while keeping technique stable.
- Track weekly volume and apply gradual overload.

## Lesson 2: Muscle Damage and Metabolic Stress

**Core idea:** Damage and metabolic stress amplify growth when paired with tension.

- Use higher-rep accessory work for metabolic stress.
- Manage soreness to protect training frequency.
- Avoid excessive damage that disrupts technique.

## Lesson 3: Satellite Cells and Myonuclear Accretion

**Core idea:** Satellite cells donate nuclei that support long-term growth capacity.

- Combine heavy and moderate loads for comprehensive signaling.
- Deload to recover connective tissue without losing myonuclei.
- Maintain high protein intake to support remodeling.

## Lesson 4: Muscle Architecture and Fiber Types

**Core idea:** Pennation and fiber distribution influence how muscles respond to training.

- Pennate muscles (e.g., quads) handle higher volume.
- Parallel-fiber muscles (e.g., biceps) respond well to stretch and load.
- Program mixed rep ranges to target multiple fiber types.
