# Muscle Growth From Cell to System

## Lesson 1: Cellular Hypertrophy Signals

**Core idea:** Mechanical tension is the primary driver; metabolic stress and muscle damage are secondary contributors.

- Use full ROM, controlled eccentrics, and proximity to failure to increase tension.
- Pair higher-rep accessory work with moderate rest to drive metabolic stress.
- Track weekly volume and gradually increase as recovery allows.

## Lesson 2: Muscle Architecture and Fiber Types

**Core idea:** Pennation and fiber-type distribution influence how muscles grow and respond to training.

- Pennate muscles (e.g., quads) often handle higher volume.
- Parallel-fiber muscles (e.g., biceps) can respond well to load and stretch.
- Use a mix of loads to target multiple fiber types.

## Lesson 3: Myonuclei and Long-Term Growth

**Core idea:** Myonuclear accretion supports sustained hypertrophy capacity.

- Deload to allow connective tissue recovery without losing myonuclei.
- Build phases that alternate overload with consolidation.
- Maintain a high protein intake to support remodeling.
